#Demos

Basic demo1 Benchmark demo showing of some graphics capabilities

Basic demo2 Demonstrates the use/usage of REFRESH

Basic demo3 Demonstration of graphic figures

Simply PASTE the code to the NEO6502 via a terminal program.

When playing around with the graphics and you want to return to the default setup, use the SANE command

When stuck type ^R to reset the 6502 and answer 'w' for a warm restart. Your program will stil be there

BTW there is a strange bug in the RND function. I half solved it but you need the RND(100) statement at the beginning of your program and only RND(0) works then
